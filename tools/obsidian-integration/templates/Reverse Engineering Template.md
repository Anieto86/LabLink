# 🕵️ Reverse Engineering: {{component-name}}

## 🎯 Discovery Mission
**Goal**: Understand {{component}} without reading docs first

## 🔍 Initial Observations
**File Size**:
**Imports**:
**Exports**:
**First Impression**:

## 🧩 Code Structure Analysis

### Functions/Methods Found
```typescript
// List all functions/methods and guess what they do
function createUser() {} // Probably creates a user?
function validateEmail() {} // Validates email format?
```

### Dependencies Discovered
- `drizzle-orm` → Database operations
- `zod` → Data validation
- `bcrypt` → Password hashing
- Custom imports:
